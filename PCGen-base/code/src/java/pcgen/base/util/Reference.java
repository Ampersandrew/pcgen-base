/**
 * A Reference is a container for storing an object that is accessed indirectly
 * (meaning the get() method of the Reference will be called).
 * 
 * This is often necessary because some objects cannot be known when someone
 * wants to store a reference to the object, so it must be referred to (and
 * references to those objects passed to others) prior to construction or
 * discovery.
 * 
 * Reference provides a method for handing off a object that can later be
 * resolved, with the get() method used at runtime to get the underlying object.
 * 
 * @param <T>
